TeamSpeak Formatting
====================

What?
-----
This Application was designed to be used in conjunction with TeamSpeak which uses a [COLOR=#ffffff]<text here>[/COLOR] approach of allowing the user to colorize their text. TeamSpeak Formatting can now take some text and put some fancy effects on top of them.

As of now several color modes have been implemented. These include:
* "rainbow"
* "emergency" --- switches between red and black every 2 letters
* "ghostly" --- text fades out
* "ghostly" --- text fades in and out
